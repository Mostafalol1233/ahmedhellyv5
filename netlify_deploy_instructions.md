# Final Netlify Deployment Instructions

## Current Configuration Status
- Python 3.9 runtime specified
- Downgraded Flask to version 2.3.3 for compatibility
- Simplified netlify.toml configuration
- Removed problematic version files

## Files Ready for Deployment

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  publish = "static"
  command = "python -m pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r netlify/functions/requirements.txt"

[functions]
  runtime = "python3.9"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/app"
  status = 200
```

### netlify/functions/requirements.txt
Compatible versions for Python 3.9:
- Flask==2.3.3
- Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.0.5
- Other dependencies with stable versions

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment with Python 3.9"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy on Netlify**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Trigger new deployment
   - Monitor build logs

3. **Environment Variables**
   Add in Netlify dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `SESSION_SECRET`

4. **Monitor Build**
   Watch for successful dependency installation and function deployment.

This configuration should resolve the Python version issues by using Netlify's native Python 3.9 support.
