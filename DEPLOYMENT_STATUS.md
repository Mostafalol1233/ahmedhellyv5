# Deployment Status - June 22, 2025

## Current Issues and Solutions

### Python Version Configuration
Both platforms are experiencing Python version specification issues. Here are the corrected configurations:

**Netlify:**
- Uses `3.11.13` in build environment
- Uses `3.11` in runtime.txt 
- Functions work with this format

**Vercel:**
- Uses `@vercel/python@4.0.0` runtime
- Requires `python3.11` in config
- Should use main requirements.txt, not separate file

### Alternative Deployment Strategy

If both platforms continue having Python version issues, consider these options:

1. **Use a separate deployment repository** with minimal dependencies
2. **Railway** - Better Python support for Flask apps
3. **PythonAnywhere** - Native Python hosting
4. **Heroku** - Reliable Python deployment

### Files to Check
- `runtime.txt` - Python version for both platforms
- `.python-version` - Specific version for Netlify
- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

### Next Steps
1. Try current deployment with corrected Python versions
2. If issues persist, create minimal deployment repository
3. Consider alternative hosting platforms

Both platforms should now work with the standardized Python version specifications.
