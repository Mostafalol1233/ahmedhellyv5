# Python Version Issue Fixed

## Problem
Netlify's build system couldn't find `python-3.11` and failed with:
```
python-build: definition not found: python-3.11
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Downgraded to Python 3.10.12** - More stable on Netlify
2. **Simplified dependencies** - Removed version conflicts
3. **Clean configuration** - Minimal netlify.toml setup
4. **Specific version pinning** - Using exact versions that work

## Current Configuration

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  publish = "static"
  command = "pip install -r netlify/functions/requirements.txt"

[build.environment]
  PYTHON_VERSION = "3.10"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "none"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/app"
  status = 200
```

### Python Version Files
- `runtime.txt`: `python-3.10.12`
- `netlify/functions/runtime.txt`: `python-3.10.12`
- `.python-version`: `3.10`

### Dependencies (netlify/functions/requirements.txt)
Using stable, compatible versions:
- Flask==3.0.3
- Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.1.1
- Flask-Login==0.6.3
- And other core dependencies with pinned versions

## Ready for Deployment
The Python version issue has been resolved. Your next deployment should succeed with these changes.
