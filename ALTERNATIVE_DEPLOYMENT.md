# Alternative Deployment Strategy

## Issue Summary
Netlify's Python environment has compatibility issues with newer Python versions and specific version requirements.

## Current Configuration
- **Python**: 3.9 (most stable on Netlify)
- **Flask**: 2.3.3 (compatible with Python 3.9)
- **Dependencies**: Downgraded to stable versions
- **Runtime**: Using Netlify's native python3.9 runtime

## Alternative Solutions if Current Fails

### Option 1: Static Site with API
Deploy as a static site and use external API hosting:
- Frontend: Netlify static hosting
- Backend: Railway, Render, or Heroku

### Option 2: Railway Deployment
Railway has better Python support:
```yaml
# railway.toml
[build]
  builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
  startCommand = "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app"
```

### Option 3: Render Deployment
```yaml
# render.yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: flask-app
    env: python
    buildCommand: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
    startCommand: "gunicorn main:app"
```

### Option 4: Vercel Deployment
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "main.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "main.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

The current Netlify configuration should work, but these alternatives are ready if needed.
